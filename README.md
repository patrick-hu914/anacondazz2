## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the University of Toronto. I'm always willing to learn new things! Besides full stack development, I'm also very interested in infrastructure, cloud technologies, and operating systems.

This page has my personal projects. Some group projects I have contributed to include:

- [Code Execution and Blogging Site](https://github.com/teddio496/CodeGrounds) - Made with Next.js, React
- [AI Trip Planner](https://github.com/teddio496/WelcoMate) - B2B Category Winner of DaVinci Hackathon
- [League of Legends Satistics Analyser](https://github.com/no-ff/no.ff) - Prototype winrate prediction model for LoL
